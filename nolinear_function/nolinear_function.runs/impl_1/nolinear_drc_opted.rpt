PLCK-58#1 Error
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a global clock-capable IO pin and BUFG pair.
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The global clock-capable IO (GCIO) is placed on a GCIO capable site (b) The BUFG is placed in the same bank of the device as the GCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.
	< set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE [get_nets clk_IBUF_inst/O] >

	clk_IBUF_inst/IBUFCTRL_INST (in clk_IBUF_inst macro) (IBUFCTRL.O) is locked to AV18 (in SLR 1)
	clk_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFGCE.I) cannot be placed

PLIO-9#1 Error
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints

Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
520 out of 527 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: in[255:0], mode[1:0], out[255:0], s_in[2:0], s_mult[2:0].
